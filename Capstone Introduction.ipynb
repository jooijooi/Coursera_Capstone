    "There are challenges in coming up with suitable **Electrical Vehicle (EV) Charging Point locations** in Singapore which is land scarce and high density. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in the United States , most Singaporeans do not have the luxury of charging their EVs in their own garages. Hence the **potential congestion** caused many cars coming back from work to a HDB carpark could create serious bottlenecks as these cars wait for availability of limited charging units available. Furthermore, charging points in HDB carparks are likely be slow chargers which require time to charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative strategy to charging while EV drivers sleep, could be charging while EV drivers are out running errands, fetching kids to enrichment classes, having a meal, doing grocery shopping or even when they are in the office on selected days. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **optimal distribution** of EV charging points is just as important as their number as the perceived lack of convenient charging points for potential EV drivers based a daily or regular routine around where they travel or live, could affect the perception of EVs as a viable and convenient alternative to internal combustion engine (ICE) cars and \n",

These include lowering the Additional Registration Fee (ARF) floor for fully electric cars and adjusting road tax for electric cars.\n",

    "### Description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, seven data sets will be used to solve the problem of locating suitable locations for EV Charging Points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common variable between most of the datasets is the **Planning Areas**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate urban planning, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) divides Singapore into planning regions, planning areas and subzones. The subzones within each Planning Area are usually centred around a focal point such as a neighbourhood centre or activity node. These planning areas are based on the Master Plan, a forward looking guiding plan for Singapore's development in the medium term over the next 10 to 15 years. Hence, planning boundaries may not coincide with existing developments for some areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of HDB Carparks will be visualized using their coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "To locate the Planning Areas where EV Charging Points are most needed by drivers and potential drivers of EVs, we will be looking at **areas with the most number of HDB dwelling units as well as employed residents who travel to work by car only, taking into account both their workplace and residential areas**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Planning Areas will also be analyzed by looking at **demographics** such as age range which could inform on the likelihood of these areas having current and potential EV car drivers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Foursquare location data** will also be used to locate the most common venues in these areas as well as those **near HDB parking lots**, which could inform on the convenience and practicality of allowing the car to be parked for a few hours in these locations.\n",
